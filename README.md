# prose 

*No subject is terrible if the story is true, if the __prose__ is clean and honest, and if it affirms courage and grace under pressure.* - Ernest Hemingway as played by Corey Stoll in *Midnight in Paris*

## tldr

```
hello = defn(name, city: "Dallas",
  name count + 1 println ;; because we can
  let(message: " " string/join(["Hello,", name, "from", city]),
    message println
    message
  )
)

hello("Howard Hughes", "Houston")
"Eleanor Roosevelt" hello("New York City")
"The Linux Users Group @ UT Dallas" hello
